# Doctopus

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gastove/doctopus.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Gastove/doctopus)

Read The Docs is a terrific project... as long as you want to use
Sphinx. In our day-to-day as coders, we might write all manner of things -- Java
with JavaDocs, folders full of `.markdown`, custom JavaScript analyzers. They're
all perfectly capable of being typeset to HTML. It's time to make it a heck of a
lot easier to get them on the web.

Doctopus is a framework for taking a project full of something-HTML-able,
generating that HTML, and serving it on the Internet. Or, if you like, it's like
RTD without the RST dependence. Also: it's trivial to host. (Not everything
should be public, y'know?)

It's also... a work in progress. Like.... very in progress. Go easy on it.

## Installation

This bit is simple, as long as you've got [lein](http://leiningen.org/) 2+ and
git installed:

```bash
        > git clone doctopus
        > cd doctopus
        > lein deps
```

This'll get almost everything you need downloaded.

You will also need an instance of [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/)
running somewhere with a fresh database to use.

Now you have a choice:

### Local Configs

You'll want to mosey on over to the `resources` directory and make a
`configuration-local.edn` by copying the template. Get a value or two configured
in there and you'll be good to go to get the whole thing spun up:

```bash
        > NOMAD_ENV=DEV lein run
```

(You can, of course, set `NOMAD_ENV` in the `rc` file of your choice.)

## Usage

Right now: you don't.
